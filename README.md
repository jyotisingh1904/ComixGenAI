# ComixGenAI
Comix Gen AI is a web application that leverages the power of AI, specifically the Stable Diffusion model, to generate comic panels based on user-provided text prompts. The user inputs a character description, scene descriptions, and dialogue, and the application generates corresponding comic panels. The platform also allows users to download their generated comic strips as JPEG files for sharing or printing.
